  "June wags her tail appreciatively.",
  "June emits small breaths through her nose that let you know she is happier than she has ever been.",
  "June nuzzles her nose to your hand as you pet her. When you stop she paws your leg requesting another petting session.",
  "June closes her eyes, a contented look of satisfaction on her small face. When the petting stops her eyes become doleful and she looks up at you pleadingly",
  "June's wagging tail pauses as she focuses all of her energy with each euphoric scratch of her ears and each soft stroke across her head. She is satiated.",
  "June is so excited by your pets that her backside begins to wag furiously. She is now an undulating small mass of happiness and excitement.",
  "June licks your hand delicately but enthusiastically, her wet nose nudging you approvingly.",
  "June sits still as a statue while you pet her. Once you have finished, she zooms around the room emitting enthusiatic noises that sound like the offspring of a pig and a vacuum cleaner.",
  "As you pet her, June's sticks the smallest tip of her tongue out of her mouth as her eyes become narrow slits. Truly this is a utopia that she didn't think attainable.",
  "Your pets are so soothing, so pleasing to June, she can't even be bothered to bark and interrupt Tim as he records the podcast with Brett.",
  "You cannot recall if you have ever seen a dog's tail wag with the vigor that June's is currenlty wagging. Truly it moves with a purpose and cadence so speedy that you fear it may rip the very fabric of space-time.",
